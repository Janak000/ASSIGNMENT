        Ganesh HimƒÅl is a sub-range of the Himalayas located mostly in north-central Nepal, but
         some peaks lie on the border with Tibet. The Trisuli Gandaki valley on the east
          separates it from the Langtang Himal; the Budhi (Buri) Gandaki valley and the Shyar
           Khola valley on the west separate it from the Sringi Himal and the Mansiri Himal 
           (home of Manaslu, the nearest 8000m peak).[2]
           <br/>

        The highest peak in the range is Yangra with an elevation of 7,422 m (24,350 ft). Three other peaks are over 7,000 m (23,000 ft) and fourteen others over 6,000 m (20,000 ft)
