        Jyamrung Trek offers you a lush green landscape, hilly landscape, and a mountainous
         region. Also, it not only shows the distribution of culture but also the diversity of 
         culture. This trek illustrates that it is not only rich in this but also full of 
         mesmerizing mountain view that is as white as snow and that seems to touch the blue sky.
          Manaslu, Annapurna Ranges, and Ganesh Himal and other peaks are full of power, and their
           huge structure reveals panoramic pleasant view, which is majestic, breath-taking, and
            grand. The distant village may not be touristy, but its view is gorgeous and charming 
            and is remarkably impressive in the eyes of a trekker 
           <br/>

    Jyamrung Trek helps you to experience the daily lifestyle of Gurung, Magar, Newar, Chhetri,
     and Brahman, which is completely different from the traditional and general world that we 
     live in. The trail also crosses through the land, devoted to the orange orchard, dense 
     forest, and rhododendron. It is greater than pleasant to wander in such a landscape because
      something your eyes see right here is the signal of wealthy nature.
