    <h1><center>Detail about Dhading</center></h1>
    <p style="font-size: 1.4vw;">
        Located at the immediate west of Kathmandu valley, Dhading city is one of the most
         underrated tourist spots of Nepal. The district headquarter is Dhading Besi. The
        word ‘Besi’ in the Nepali language means lowlands in the river basin, the reason 
         many people settled here. Dhading is the only district of Nepal which ranges from
           the mountain Ganesh Himal to the Churevawar Pradesh of Terai. Dhading is shaped 
           like a military boot from above."
