<!-- HTML tags like <a> can have certain attributes. The href attribute is mandatory in 
    the <a> tag. Additionally it is possible to use the title attribute which specifies a
     text that emerges when the mouse cursor is moved above a link. This kind of text is 
     called a tool tip. Modify the link that you created in the previous exercise so that a 
     tool tip says "This leads you to another page." when the mouse cursor is over the link.-->
